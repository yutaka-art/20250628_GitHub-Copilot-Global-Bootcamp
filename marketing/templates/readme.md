## Templates

These `.pptx` files are editable templates created for use on social media and event platforms. Each file is formatted for a specific channel:

- Instagram (1350x1080 - format)
- LinkedIn (1080x1080 – format)
- Meetup.com (event cover image)

Organizers can customize the templates by adding the logo of their community, partner organizations, and relevant event details such as the title, date, time, and speakers.
